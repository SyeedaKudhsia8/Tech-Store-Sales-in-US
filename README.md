## Introduction
The tech sales industry in the US is a dynamic and rapidly evolving sector. This project focuses on analyzing sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Merging the Data from Each Month into One File 
The sales data for each month is stored in separate CSV files. We merge these files into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This section covers:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting data types
- Standardizing formats
- Augmenting data with additional columns

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data. This section includes:
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis


## Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis is performed to validate the findings from the EDA. This section includes:
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression analysis
- Time series analysis

## Conclusion
1. The best month for sales was December, with total earnings of $4,613,443.34.
2. The city with the highest sales was San Francisco (CA).
3. The best times for advertisements are around 11 AM-12 PM and 7 PM.
4.  The product that sold the most was AAA Batteries, likely due to their widespread use in electronics and relatively low cost.

## Future Work
This section outlines potential areas for further research and analysis, such as:
- Incorporating additional data sources
- Applying machine learning models
- Conducting more granular analysis

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- jupyter
